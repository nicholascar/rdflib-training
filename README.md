# rdflib-training
A repository containing resources for screen-share training with the Python [RDFlib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) family or tools, used to manipulate [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).

## How to use
This repository contains files that step through common tasks for the basic use of RDFlib's core package, `rdflib` and some additional packages, so far `SPARQLWrapper` & `pyshacl`.

**NOTE**: so far, this repository only contains annotated Python files, but these will be converted to Jupyter Notebooks shortly!

Just start by opening these Python files and reading through them, in sequence:

1. *setup.md* - steps to set up your Python environment to perform the tasks in the other files
2. *core.py* - tasks for the core RDFlib package
3. *sparqlwrapper.py* - tasks for the SPARQLWrapper package
4. *pyshacl.py* - tasks for the core pySHACL package
