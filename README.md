# rdflib-training
A repository containing resources for screen-share training with the Python [RDFlib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) family or tools, used to manipulate [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).

## How to use
This repository contains files that step through common tasks for the basic use of RDFlib's core package, `rdflib` and some additional packages, so far `SPARQLWrapper` & `pyshacl`.

So far, this repository only contains annotated Python files, but these will be converted to Jupyter Notebooks shortly!

1. *core.py* - tasks for the core RDFlib package
2. *sparqlwrapper.py* - tasks for the SPARQLWrapper package
3. *pyshacl.py* - tasks for the core pySHACL package
