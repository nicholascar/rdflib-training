    skos:definition "A percussion drilling method that uses a heavy drilling tool that is raised and lowered with enough force to pulverise the rock, with the debris removed by a bailer. Although this drilling method has largely been supplanted in recent years by other, faster drilling techniques, it is still the most practicable drilling method for large diameter, deep bedrock wells, and in widespread use for small rural water supply wells. The impact of the drill bit fractures the rock and in many shale rock situations increases the water flow into a well over rotary. Many large diameter water supply wells, especially deep wells completed in bedrock aquifers, were completed using this drilling method."@en ;

Compressed air passes down to the drill bit along the annular space between an outer and inner drill rod to return to the surface carrying drill cuttings. This is the reverse of the air path employed in normal open hole rotary percussion drilling (including RAB drilling). At the top of the hole, the air and drill cuttings are passed through a cyclone to collect the cuttings for sampling. The RC drilling technique prevents the upcoming sample from being contaminated with material from the wall of the hole above the sampling depth. RC drilling utilises much larger rigs and machinery and depths of up to 500 metres are routinely achieved."@en ;

The diamonds used are fine to microfine industrial grade diamonds. They are set within a matrix of varying hardness, from brass to high-grade steel. Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the rock which must be cut. Holes within the bit allow water to be delivered to the cutting face. This provides three essential functions: lubrication, cooling, and removal of drill cuttings from the hole. Core samples are retrieved via the use of a core tube, a hollow tube placed inside the rod string and pumped with water until it locks into the core barrel. As the core is drilled, the core barrel slides over the core as it is cut. An 'overshot' attached to the end of the winch cable is lowered inside the rod string and locks on to the backend (aka head assembly), located on the top end of the core barrel. The winch is retracted, pulling the core tube to the surface. The core does not drop out of the inside of the core tube when lifted because either a split ring core lifter or basket retainer allow the core to move into, but not back out of the tube."@en ;

The drill cuttings are removed by injection of compressed air into the hole via the annular area between the innertube and the drill rod. The cuttings are then blown back to surface up the inner tube where they pass through the sample separating system and are collected if needed. Drilling continues with the addition of rods to the top of the drill string. Air core drilling can occasionally produce small chunks of cored rock."@en ;

Oil well drilling of this type utilises tri-cone roller, carbide embedded, fixed-cutter diamond, or diamond-impregnated drill bits. This is preferred because there is no need to return intact samples to surface for assay as the objective is to reach a formation containing oil or natural gas. Sizable machinery is used, enabling depths of several kilometres to be penetrated. Rotating hollow drill pipes carry down bentonite and barite infused drilling muds to lubricate, cool, and clean the drilling bit, control downhole pressures, stabilize the wall of the borehole and remove drill cuttings."@en ;

Vibrations may also be generated within the drill head. The frequency is generally between 50 and 180 hertz (cycles per second) and can be varied by the operator. Resonance magnifies the amplitude of the drill bit, which fluidizes the soil particles at the bit face, allowing for fast and easy penetration through most geological formations. An internal spring system isolates these vibrational forces from the rest of the drill rig."@en ;
